    "brief_summary": "Radiotherapy plus Single-Agent Chemotherapy/Radiosensitization. Involved-field irradiation\n      using 4-15 MV photons; plus Gemcitabine, NSC-613327.",
    "detailed_description": "This is a Phase I trial of gemcitabine given weekly as a 30 minute infusion administered\n      concurrently with radiation in patients with locally advanced or locally recurrent\n      pancreatic carcinoma. Patients will be treated with external beam radiation therapy in a\n      standard manner. Gemcitabine will be administered as a 30 minute infusion beginning on the\n      first day of irradiation and weekly afterwards for a total of 5 doses. Patients will be\n      assessed clinically for acute toxicity which will be graded per RTOG and DCT toxicity\n      grading system.",
